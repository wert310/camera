# camera

Display the live feed from a camera device.

This is essentially the code of [this SDL example](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/main/examples/camera/01-read-and-draw/read-and-draw.c), with command line arguments to select the camera, the window size and a keyboard shortcut to enable and disable full screen mode.
